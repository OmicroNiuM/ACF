--For an extended version history, please visit the github changelog.  https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/commits/master

*r486
--New cannon and short cannon models
--Short cannons added, which trade penetration and accuracy for size and light weight
--37mm cannon added
--Large b6, v8, v12 engines buffed
--Small v12, v12 special slightly buffed
--New multifuel v6 special added
--Turbines have much more power, but now require fuel

*r487
--fixed something in cannon models

*r489
--Short-barrel cannons adjusted: gun weight decreased a bit to account for heavier shells, RoF changed slightly.

*r490
--Cannon and short-barrel cannon models are now skinnier
--CoH sounds fixed
--Small v12 petrol/diesel and medium v8 diesel weight slightly increased
--Large CVT torque rating increased from 3400 to 6000
--37mm cannon name fixed
--37mm short-barrel cannon rof adjusted

*r491
--New tank engine and misc sounds

*r492
--Resampled new sounds to 44100 hz

*r493
--Diesel engines now have much more hp
--Diesels can take a bit more damage before performance starts to degrade

*r494
--New tracers that are a bit brighter and much easier on older systems, courtesy of Techa
--Turbine fuel consumption doubled
--Diesel fuel is no longer explosive
--Refuel sound is much quieter

*r495
-HEAT rebalanced: 
--HEAT HE reduced, 22% (down from 33%) of a HE shell of same caliber.
--HE effect is correctly sized
--penetrator loses less energy on initial penetration, but loses massive amounts on successive penetrations. End effect is layered armor is much more effective at stopping penetrator.
--penetrator deals 13.2x more damage to crates, roughly equal to an AP shell of the same caliber as the HEAT shell.
--penetrator deals 6.6x more damage to engines and fuel tanks, roughly half of an AP shell.
--penetrator damage to everything else is unchanged.
-Diesel explosions can be triggered by HE or HEAT.
-HE blast radius and blast energy is now correctly displayed on the tool and overlays.
